<p>I held the role of Entrepreneur in Residence (EIR) at <a href="https://www.labs.robinhood.org" target="_blank">Blue Ridge Labs at Robin Hood</a>, as part of the <a href="https://www.labs.robinhood.org/our-programs/launch-fellowship" target="_blank">Launch Fellowship</a> (August 2024 - December 2024) where I created <strong><a href="http://wearecommonresolve.com" target="_blank">Common Resolve</a></strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong><a href="https://www.labs.robinhood.org/our-programs/launch-fellowship" target="_blank">Launch Fellowship</a></strong> is 13-week program that helps early-stage tech founders grow and shape their ventures into something meaningful, with a focus on building <strong>tech ventures that fight poverty</strong>. </p>

<h2>Common Resolve</h2>

<p>
    At <strong><a href="https://wearecommonresolve.com" target="_blank">Common Resolve</a></strong>, we developed a <strong><a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/common-resolve/hemkacfkmhldlhpfndjfibkalfphiibf" target="_blank">Chrome Extension</a></strong> to identifying the likelihood of a job listing being a "ghost." Our tool leverages data-driven insights to help job seekers focus their efforts on genuine opportunities, saving them time and energy by analyzing patterns in job listings to detect fake or misleading posts.

    In the current job market, workers face a significant challenge: ghost job listings. 
    A <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwells/2024/08/13/36-of-job-adverts-are-fake-how-to-spot-them-in-2024/" target="_blank">Forbes survey</a> 
    revealed that <strong>36% of all job postings online are fake</strong>, meaning job seekers waste 
    <strong>one-third of their time</strong> applying to positions that don’t exist. This not only frustrates 
    workers but also undermines the efficiency of the entire job market.

<p>
    Our mission is driven by a team of dedicated professionals who understand the struggles of job seekers. I worked with 
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tahneepantig" target="_blank">Tahnee Pantig</a> (Product Designer), with a passion for creating equitable solutions for workers, and 
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marypryor" target="_blank">Mary Pryor</a> (Strategist), dedicated to addressing inefficiencies in the job market.  Together, we are committed to building tools <strong>for workers, by workers</strong>, because everyone deserves 
    better in today’s job market.
